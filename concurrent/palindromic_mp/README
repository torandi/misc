A program that finds palindromic words in a word list.

Build:
make

Usage:
./palindromic num_workers

num_workers: Number of worker threads, required

Speedup with threading:
Without any threading (and no threading overhead) the program ran for 0.0098s
With 8 workers (on a i7 with hyperthreading) the program ran for 0.0020 yielding a speedup of 4.9

This is the same speedup that was achieved using pthreads

Variations:

Normal wordlist:
2 threads: 0.0050 => speedup 1.96
4 threads: 0.0030s => speedup 3.26
8 threads: 0.0020s => speedup 4.9

Bigger wordlist:
1 thread: 0.0367
2 threads: 0.0182 => speedup 2.016
4 threads: 0.0101 => speedup 2.633
8 threads: 0.0067 => speedup 5.477
